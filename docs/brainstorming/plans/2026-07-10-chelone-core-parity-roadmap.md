# Chelone — ra-core Parity Roadmap (post-v1)

**Date:** 2026-07-10 · Derived from the parity analysis (`chelone/.superpowers/sdd/core-parity/PARITY-REPORT.md`) vs react-admin `ra-core` 5.14.7. · Work repo `chelone` (commit to main, never push).

**State:** near-parity on ra-core's load-bearing surface (data/list/edit/create/show/form/i18n/routing/notification/DataTable/shell) + architectural extension (Zod registry, framework-agnostic core proven by the Vue adapter). NOT full feature parity — a bounded, mostly-deliberate gap list. This roadmap prioritizes closing it.

**Prioritization = user-facing value ÷ effort, honoring the thesis (keep core framework-agnostic; every gap closed must stay zero-React-in-core and land in BOTH adapters or in vanilla core).**

## Tier 1 — high value, bounded (do next)

### R1. URL-synced / bookmarkable lists ⭐ (STARTING NOW)
- **Gap:** Chelone list params (filter/sort/page/perPage) are KV-only; not reflected in the URL. react-admin's `useListParams` syncs them to the location query string (`?filter=…&sort=…&page=…`), so list state is bookmarkable/shareable/back-button-aware. A staple react-admin UX.
- **Design (Chelone-idiomatic, thesis-safe):** pure `listParams ⇄ querystring` serializer in `@chelone/core` (no router — `serializeListParams`/`parseListParams`, mirroring ra-core's `parseQueryFromLocation`/stringify). The *adapter* (`@chelone/react` + `@chelone/vue` `useListController`) wires that serializer to its RouterPort/router (read initial params from the location, push param changes to the URL), gated by a `syncWithLocation`/`disableSyncWithLocation` option (off for embedded lists). Core list controller stays router-free.
- **Effort:** M. Reference: ra-core `controller/list/useListParams.ts` + `queryReducer`.

### R2. Permissions / access-control axis 🔒
- **Gap:** auth *identity* works (login/logout/getIdentity/authState), but the PERMISSIONS layer is partial/unwired: `usePermissions`/`getPermissions`, `canAccess`/`useCanAccess`/`CanAccess`, `checkError`→auto-logout (`useLogoutIfAccessDenied`), resource/action access gating in controllers.
- **Design:** the `canAccessWithPermissions` matcher already exists vanilla in core — extend: add `usePermissions`/`useCanAccess` composables (both adapters) over the authProvider `getPermissions`/`canAccess`; wire `checkError`→logout into the data/mutation error path; gate menu items + view actions on access (the menu already tolerantly hides — make it access-driven). Security-adjacent → do carefully.
- **Effort:** M.

### R3. Undoable mutation mode ↩️
- **Gap:** react-admin's signature optimistic-with-Undo flow (mutationMode `undoable`): mutate optimistically, show a notification with an Undo button + a delay, commit on timeout / revert on undo. Chelone has the seam (mutationMode plumbing) but not the flow, nor undoable notifications (Undo button, autoHideDuration, beforeunload guard).
- **Design:** add the undoable mutation queue in core (vanilla: a deferred-commit registry with commit/undo), + the adapter notification with an Undo action + timer. Pairs with the Notification gaps (undoable/autoHide/multiLine).
- **Effort:** M–L.

## Tier 2 — medium value

### R4. Infinite list + saved queries
- Infinite-scroll list controller (`useInfiniteGetList` + `useInfiniteListController`) + saved queries (persist named filter/sort sets to the store). Effort M.

### R5. Data-provider power tools
- `useGetManyAggregate` (N+1 → single `getMany` batching per tick — a real perf win), `useGetManyReference` hook, `withLifecycleCallbacks` (beforeGetList/afterCreate/etc.), `combineDataProviders`, `HttpError` + `fetchUtils` (a batteries-included REST helper). Effort M.

### R6. Server-side reverse-relation fields
- `useReferenceManyFieldController`/`useReferenceOneFieldController` with server pagination/sort/filter/selection (Chelone's reverse-relation fields are client-side). `ReferenceManyCount`. Effort M.

## Tier 3 — deferred / lower priority (charter-deferred or niche)

### R7. Preferences / Configurable / Inspector
- The whole `usePreference` + `Configurable` + `Inspector` (in-app "customize this component" panel) system. Big, cohesive, deferred by charter. Effort L.

### R8. Guessers / inference — reframe as a Chelone EXTENSION
- ra-core's guessers sniff data values/name-heuristics to infer views. Chelone deliberately skipped them. BUT the Zod registry is a *better* substrate: a schema→view scaffolder (`z.infer` field types → default List/Edit/Show columns) would be *typed* inference, not data-sniffing — arguably surpassing ra-core. Frame as a NEW extension feature, not a port. Effort M–L.

### R9. i18n depth
- Translatable multi-locale field editing (`useTranslatable`/`TranslatableContext`), async/lazy locale loading, `resolveBrowserLocale`, `mergeTranslations`, a `<Translate>` component. Effort M.

### R10. Realtime / enterprise
- realtime (`useSubscribe`/live queries/locks), audit-log, ra-tree, calendar. Large, ecosystem-scale, deferred (was always post-v1 per the charter). Effort XL.

## Sequencing

**STATUS 2026-07-10 — TIER 1 COMPLETE. ✅ R1 URL-synced lists · ✅ R2 permissions/access-control · ✅ R3 undoable mutations.** All three closed in BOTH adapters, core stayed framework-free (external react/vue/router import grep = empty across all additions), core 590 / react 1241 / vue 493 green, vue-demo builds. R1 browser-verified (deep-link seed + page-push). R2 security semantics verified both directions (checkError-reject→logout, resolve→stay; fail-open-when-unconfigured). R3 data-integrity verified by spy counts (server 0× on undo, 1× on commit; rollback on undo + commit-error; beforeunload commit). The gate that held: parity work ADDS to core (additive vanilla), invariant = core stays REACT/framework-FREE, not zero-core-change.

**Next: Tier 2** (R4 infinite-list/saved-queries · R5 data-provider power tools · R6 server-side reverse-relations), then Tier 3. Each lands in both adapters on the framework-free core with the SDD wave rhythm (implementer + reviewer + probe + opus).
