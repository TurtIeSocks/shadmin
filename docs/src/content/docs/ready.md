title: "Ready"
---

Splash screen displayed when no `<Resource>` is configured under `<Admin>`. Renders a welcome panel with links to documentation, the live demo, and the GitHub repository, so new developers see a non-empty page on their first run.

## Usage

`<Admin>` renders `<Ready>` automatically when it has no `<Resource>` children. To swap in your own placeholder, pass a component to the `ready` prop:

```tsx
import { Admin } from "@/components/admin";
import { Ready } from "@/components/admin/ready";

const App = () => (
  <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider} ready={Ready}>
    {/* no <Resource> yet — shows <Ready> */}
  </Admin>
);
```

To replace it with a custom splash:

```tsx
import { Admin } from "@/components/admin";

const MyReady = () => (
  <div className="p-8 text-center">
    <h1 className="text-2xl">Welcome to my admin</h1>
    <p>Add a Resource to get started.</p>
  </div>
);

const App = () => <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider} ready={MyReady} />;
```

`<Ready>` takes no props.
